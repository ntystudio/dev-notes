Event Dispatchers (Delegates) follow an Observer programming pattern that allows us to create an event other objects can subscribe to and subsequently respond when the event is triggered.

The (primary) actions available when using Event Dispatchers (Delegates) are:
- `Call`
- `Bind`
- `Event`
- `Assign`

# Call
`Call` is used to broadcast the event to all subscribed listeners. If we had an `OnHealthChanged` event dispatcher, we would call this event whenever the health changed of something changed, broadcasting the event to all subscribed listeners.

# Bind
`Bind` is used to register a function to listen for the event. When the event is dispatched (or called), any bound function is executed.

# Assign
`Assign` is similar to `Bind`, except that when you `Assign` an Event Dispatcher (delegate), the assignment is spawned with a custom event node attached.

# Event
`Event` creates a new event in the blueprint graph with a matching signature of the event being referenced.
