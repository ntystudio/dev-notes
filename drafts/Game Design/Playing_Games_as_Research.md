Rarely do I ever finish a game I start.

Not because I can't, but in playing games for research, my metric for "completion" isn't about finishing them; it's about understanding what makes them tick.

The core gameplay loop and specifics of the genre(s) are what I'm after. I'm trying to see how different elements come together to construct the player's core experience.

What works, what doesn't, and why?

You can gleam plenty of insights from reading or watching videos, but nothing is more effective than being on the receiving end of a game trying to influence your behavior and decision making, whether through its story, level design, skill progression, or the hundred other design principles that can influence the core gameplay experience.

If you want to make great games, you've got to play great games — and not so great ones — to understand the difference.

It's about getting a feel for the medium in as broad and deep a way as possible.

That's how you start to see the possibilities for your own work, and how you can start pushing the envelope yourself.

# How to start playing games as research

My current process involves recording playthroughs in segments of ~45 minutes. I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) (free and open source) to capture my input audio (microphone), output audio (game), and monitor display (game). I then upload my videos to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeN6pPFDA-UZeL-5qAqAynA) and occasionally transcribe them when I think the playthrough warrants it.

During this time, I'm annotating what I'm thinking, seeing, experiencing, and observing during my gameplay. Questions I ask myself include:

- How is the environment trying to guide me?
- What is the core gameplay loop?
- What is my relationship with the world and its inhabitants?
- How am I rewarded for exploration?
- How is the game trying to influence my decisions?
- How is the pacing of the story?
- How is the progression of the game?
- How am I being introduced to new mechanics or skills as the game moves forward?
- How is the environment used to facilitate the game's story and mechanics?
- How is the world being brought to life?

Eventually these questions become second nature and you'll intuitively start to notice patterns, trends, and inconsistencies that unfold during play.

# Reasons to play games as research

There are too many reasons to count, but below is my short list of the more critical motivations to play games as research.

### Genre Exploration (and exposure)

Video games are rarely inventive. In its most innovative form, they're often a blend of genres with a fresh perspective.

Playing games across different genres helps you understand the mechanics, themes, and experiences unique to the genre, which further helps you understand where-and-how you can creatively blend them to create something new (or improved).

### Game Flow Analysis

The first 30 minutes of a game are quite telling about its general game design philosophy, and seeing how games introduce me to their world is one of my favorite things to survey.

Am I left to figure mechanics out on my own? Or are mechanics instead spoon-fed to me through a litany of hints?

Am I thrown directly into the action, or does the game instead slowly build up my confidence before throwing me into the fray?

Am I guided through the story with explicit narration, or does the story instead rely on player interest through interpretive environmental clues?

### Keeping up with Trends

How did [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/) generate $120 million in 3 weeks from a solo developer? How did an indie "Pokemon with Guns" game ([Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/)) hit a peak of ~2.1 million concurrent players?

The gaming industry is (largely) unpredictable and player expectations are ever-evolving. Playing a range of popular games (even if it's not to your taste) can help you to dissect what makes new entrants to the industry sticky.

### Technical Research

No two games are identical and every one attempts to iterate upon their predecessors in some way. Playing a variety of games exposes you to different approaches and implementations in physics, AI, interfaces, graphics, and much more. This perspective helps recognize where common limits are or where teams have gotten creative with constraints.
