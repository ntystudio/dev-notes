Location Markers are navigational aides provided by the game (as opposed to Location Pins which are player-defined navigational indicators) used to help players identify points of interest or key locations. They're often seen in the form of text, an icon, or both.

Even with distinct text and iconography, Location Markers can still be challenging to quickly identify, especially for players with visual impairments. Below are a few guidelines to follow when designing Location Markers.

---

# Utilize Color Strategically
Employ color as a key component of your visual language to differentiate between types of objectives or locations.

For example, use:
- Green for main objectives
- Blue for side objectives
- Purple for bonus objectives

Choose colors that are easily distinguishable from one another, keeping in mind color blindness by avoiding problematic color combinations.

# Ensure Consistent and Contextual Iconography
Icons should be intuitive and reflective of their function or location type: 
- A seed icon for farming locations
- A chat bubble icon for interactive NPCs
- A fireplace icon for a rest area
- A key icon for an unlockable door

Consistency in design and context helps reduce the cognitive overhead for players as it relates to their need to constantly reference what icon refers to which gameplay component.

# Provide Clear Contrast and Legibility
Ensure that both the text and icons of Location Markers stand out against the game's background. 

High contrast and legible font choices are essential for players to easily identify and read markers without straining.

---

# Offer Filtering Options
Provide players with the ability to filter out or customize the visibility of certain types of markers. 

This feature allows individuals to manage their cognitive load by focusing on markers relevant to their current objective or preferences.

---

# Allow Adjustable Marker Sizes
Allow players to adjust the size of Location Markers to combat visual clutter for those with visual impairments.

This customization ensures that Location Makers are neither too intrusive nor too difficult to see, catering to a wide range of visual preferences and needs.

# Location Marker References in Horizon Zero Dawn
In the gameplay video below, we see the main quest line for Alloy has a distinct style. As Alloy is walking down the cliff, a new location appears with a separate icon and color (the green exclamation mark). This visual distinction helps to minimize the cognitive load of the player when deciding whether they want to maintain their current path or deviate for something new.
