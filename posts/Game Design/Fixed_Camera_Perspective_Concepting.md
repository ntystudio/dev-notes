When building isometric or fixed-perspective games, we employ a technique during the concept hase to emulate the player's viewpoint, effectively allowing us to roleplay as the player.

This involves overlaying a dark gradient layer with a central rectangle cutout over the concept art to represent the player's screen. We position the character in the middle of this frame and move the layer around the environment, simulating the player's movement.

It's been a wildly effective design technique for early-stage brainstorming among the team.
