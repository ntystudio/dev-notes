The list below is a collection of lightning talks given by the NTY team covering various design, development, and creative topics.

The purpose of these talks are to give team members the opportunity to share their knowledge and experiences with the rest of the team. This helps to reinforce what they've learned and teach others in the team.

This is a living, breathing collection we update as new lightning talks are released on your [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nty.studio/videos).
